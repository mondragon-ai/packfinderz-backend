## Title [PF-124]: Add Admin authentication model + role (storeless)

## Type

Feature

## Description

Define how **admin users** authenticate and authorize **without Store context** so they can access `/api/admin/*` routes for license verification, payouts, and other privileged operations.

## Scope

* Add/confirm an **admin role** in `enums.MemberRole` (or dedicated `SystemRole` if you split later)
* Ensure JWT claims can represent an admin session **with no activeStoreId / storeType**
* Ensure middleware + route guards support **storeless admin requests**

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Admin JWTs can be minted/parsed with `ActiveStoreID=nil` and `StoreType=nil` and still pass auth.
* [ ] `RequireRole("admin")` works for admin requests based on JWT role claim.
* [ ] Admin routes do **not** require store context (no 403/500 due to missing store_id).

## Dependencies

* Blocked by: none
* Blocks: Admin login route; Admin user provisioning

## Technical Notes

* Reuse existing JWT machinery if possible:

  * `Auth` middleware already sets `ctxStoreID` only if `claims.ActiveStoreID != nil`.
  * The risky piece is `middleware.StoreContext(logg)` on `/api/admin` routes — this should be removed or made conditional.
* **ASSUMPTION:** `enums.MemberRole` currently does *not* include `"admin"`; if it does, this ticket becomes mostly route/middleware changes.

## Out of Scope

* MFA, email verification, SSO, Cognito/Firebase adapter

## Title [PF-125]: Implement Admin login endpoint (storeless) + token issuance

## Type

Feature

## Description

Create a dedicated admin login route so a privileged operator can obtain JWT + refresh token and access admin-only APIs.

## Scope

* New route: `POST /api/admin/v1/auth/login`
* Request: `{ "email": string, "password": string }`
* Response: `{ "user": <admin user dto> }`
* Use existing password hash verification + session manager (Redis) rotation model

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Valid admin credentials return `200` with `accessToken` added to the X-Pf-Token header (same as current login).
* [ ] Invalid credentials return `401` with the standard invalid credentials message (match existing behavior).
* [ ] Returned JWT has role = `admin` and **does not require** store claims.
* [ ] `last_login_at` is updated for admin user on successful login (same as current login).

## Dependencies

* Blocked by: PF-XXX (Admin role storeless support)
* Blocks: Admin route hardening + integration harness

## Technical Notes

* You can reuse the existing `Login` flow structure with a simplified variant:

  * Lookup user by email
  * Verify password
  * Confirm `user.IsActive`
  * Confirm user is admin via `user.SystemRole == "admin"` (or however you encode it)
  * Mint access token with `ActiveStoreID=nil`, `StoreType=nil`, `Role=admin`
  * Create refresh token with `sessionManager.Generate(ctx, accessID)`
* Consider putting this in `internal/auth/service.go` to avoid polluting store login service.
* **ASSUMPTION:** Admin users live in the same `users` table and are distinguished by `SystemRole` (since your current login already supports `SystemRole` override).

## Out of Scope

* Admin registration endpoint (handled separately)
* Refresh endpoint changes (unless you decide admins need separate refresh semantics)

## Title [PF-125a]: Refactor `/api/admin` router to remove StoreContext requirement

## Type

Task

## Description

Your current admin router applies `middleware.StoreContext(logg)` even though admins are not associated with a store. This will likely break requests when `ctxStoreID` is absent.

## Scope

* Update the router setup for `/api/admin`:

  * Keep: `Auth`, `RequireRole("admin")`, `Idempotency`, `RateLimit`
  * Remove (or conditionalize): `StoreContext`
* If any admin endpoints truly need store_id (e.g., acting “as” a store), that should be explicit in payload/path and validated there—not implied via store context middleware.

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] `GET /api/admin/ping` works with an admin JWT that has no `active_store_id`.
* [ ] Existing buyer/vendor routes that depend on `StoreContext` remain unchanged.
* [ ] No panics / internal errors when admin JWT has `ActiveStoreID=nil`.

## Dependencies

* Blocked by: PF-XXX (Admin login)
* Blocks: Admin features (license verify, payouts) reliably working

## Technical Notes

* Smallest change: remove `r.Use(middleware.StoreContext(logg))` from the `/api/admin` subtree.
* Alternative: change `StoreContext` middleware to be a no-op if role is admin, but that’s riskier (it changes behavior globally).

  * If you do conditional logic, gate it strictly on `RoleFromContext(ctx) == "admin"`.

## Out of Scope

* Reworking StoreContext implementation everywhere

## Title [PF-126]: Dev-only Admin Register endpoint (no-auth) at `/api/admin/v1/auth/register`

## Type

Feature

## Description

Add a **DEV-ONLY** unauthenticated endpoint to create/register an **admin user** by sending `{email, password}` in the request body. The handler MUST:

* create a `users` row with `system_role="admin"` + `is_active=true`
* hash the password using the existing security helper
* mint JWT + refresh token (same pattern as existing register/login)
* return user DTO in response body
* return tokens consistent with your existing auth responses (and also set access token in header, per request)

This endpoint is explicitly for local/dev testing and MUST be disabled in production builds/environments.

## Scope

* Route: `POST /api/admin/v1/auth/register`
* No JWT auth middleware on this route
* Request body:

  ```json
  { "email": "admin@x.com", "password": "..." }
  ```
* Response body:

  ```json
  {
    "user": { ...UserDTO... }
  }
  ```
* Response headers:

  * `w.Header().Set("X-PF-Token", <AccessToken>)`

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] In **dev** (`APP_ENV=dev` or equivalent), calling `POST /api/admin/v1/auth/register` with a valid email/password:

  * creates a new user with:

    * `email` normalized to lowercase/trimmed
    * `password_hash` created via your password hashing helper
    * `system_role="admin"`
    * `is_active=true`
  * returns `200` or `201` with:

    * `"X-PF-Token: <accessToken>` header present
    * `user` DTO in body
* [ ] Duplicate email returns `409` (or your existing conflict code) with a clear error message.
* [ ] Invalid payload returns `422`/validation error consistent with your API conventions.
* [ ] In **prod** (`APP_ENV=prod` or equivalent), the endpoint is **not available**:

  * returns `404` OR `403` with “disabled in production” (pick one convention and stick to it)
  * cannot be enabled accidentally without explicit config

## Dependencies

* Blocked by: none
* Blocks: fast admin testing without psql/CLI

## Technical Notes

* **Hard gate**: do not rely on “I’ll remove the route later.” Implement an explicit guard:

  * only mount the route when `cfg.Env != "prod"` (router-level)
* User creation should be atomic:

  * check email uniqueness (DB unique index ideally) and handle conflict cleanly
  * hash password before insert
* Token minting:

  * Use the same `session.NewAccessID()` + `pkgAuth.MintAccessToken(...)` + `sessionManager.Generate(...)`
  * Mint JWT with `Role=admin`, `ActiveStoreID=nil`, `StoreType=nil`
* DTO:

  * reuse `users.FromModel(user)` (or equivalent) to avoid leaking sensitive fields
* **Headers**:

  * You asked for “returns the token in the header like register/login routes” — your current login sample returns tokens in body. So implement:

    * body includes tokens (existing pattern)
    * header includes Authorization bearer token (your requested extra behavior)

## Out of Scope

* Public admin registration
* SendGrid invites
* MFA / email verification
* Admin password reset flows

## Title [PF-XXX]: Integration tests for admin auth + protected admin routes (happy + unhappy paths)

## Type

Task

## Description

Add coverage that proves admin auth is storeless and that protected admin endpoints enforce role-based access.

## Scope

* Tests (API-level):

  * Admin login success
  * Admin login failure (bad password)
  * Access `/api/admin/ping`:

    * succeeds with admin token
    * fails with buyer/vendor token (403)
    * fails with no token (401)

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] CI-friendly scripted run can authenticate as admin and call `GET /api/admin/ping`.
* [ ] Non-admin tokens cannot call admin endpoints (`403 role required`).
* [ ] Missing/invalid token returns `401`.

## Dependencies

* Blocked by: Admin login + provisioning + router refactor tickets
* Blocks: Confident rollout of admin-only features (license verify, payouts)

## Technical Notes

* Fits naturally into your Phase 13 integration harness (`/scripts/integration/`) using real HTTP calls.
* Use env vars like:

  * `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `API_BASE_URL`

## Out of Scope

* Deep license verify workflow tests (that’s a separate “admin licenses” ticket set)
